## Description

This is a command line application that allows buisness owners to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company.

To start the application, navigate to the root directory of Employee-Tracker and enter "npm start" into the command line. You will be presented with the following options: view all departments, roles, or employees, add a departmtment, role, or employee, and update an employee's role. The application will present you any data in formatted tables, and will store data you enter in an SQL database.

The database includes references between the different data types, so that it tracks which department each role belongs too, and which role each employee has. When you select to view all departments, you are presented with each department's name and ID. When you select to view all roles, you are presented with each role's title, id, salary, and the department the role belongs to. When you select to view all employees, you are presented with each employee's first and last names, ID, role, salary, department, and manager (if the employee has one).
